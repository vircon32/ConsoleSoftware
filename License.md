# License

This repository contains several elements, so any of them might have their own license. But unless otherwise specified, the global license is:
- Software is provided under the [3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause).
- Assets and documents are provided under [CC BY 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

In general it is fine to assume that all of my own content will keep these default licences. But when external software or assets are used, they may have their own specific licenses. Check the corresponding readme files for this.

The intent of Vircon32 is to be open and free, that is why the chosen licenses are very permissive and should allow most uses.
