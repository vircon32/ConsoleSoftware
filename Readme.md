# Vircon32: Console software

This is a general repository containing sources for all "official" console software, written by the Vircon32 creator. These projects have been written following a clear structure and using many comments. That way they can serve as practical examples for anyone wanting to learn how to create games for Vircon32.

This includes any software running on the console itself:
- Games
- Demos
- Tutorials and examples
- The BIOS

However, it does not include any PC software related to Vircon32 such as the following:
- Vircon32 emulators
- Development tools
- The C compiler's standard library
  (it DOES run on the console, but it is part of the compiler)
