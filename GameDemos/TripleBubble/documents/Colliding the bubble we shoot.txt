Raycast

Origin + Angle
  --> Ray trajectory (with wall bouncing) --> actually 1 ray per bounce
  --> Ordered list of areas the ray contacts (with their time of entry in frames)
  
---------------------------------------------

We don't need to recalculate this every frame!
Only when the angle actually changes

---------------------------------------------

For each individual ray we can split the ray collision detection into a list
of collisions with each row. This is possible because we know the trajectory
always goes upwards.
