  NOTES:
---------------------------
    This is a technical demo, meant to show how to achieve pseudo-3D
    effects for a racer type game. As such there is no gameplay or
    real driving here. The car remains at the center, and the player
    controls road curvature pressing left and right. Pressing up
    increases speed, and down decreases it. You can also move in
    reverse if you keep pressing down.
