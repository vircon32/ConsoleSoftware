In this tutorial we are showing a technique (rather
than an effect) that enables the programmer to render
3D polygons in a console like Vircon32, which has
no graphic functions to draw 3D at all.

=============================
   3D POLYGONS TECHNIQUE
=============================
In this example we are basically implementing a very
simplified 3D rendered in software. This program
only uses a texture with a single white line, and
to draw polygons it will decompose them in scanlines
of 1 pixel each. By redefining a segment of the same
line each time and drawing it at different heights
and colors it is able to form each polygon.

Explaining the full detail of how a software 3D
engine is implemented is beyond the scope of this
tutorial, but you will find plenty of comments in
the program's code.

================================
  LIMITATIONS OF THE TECHNIQUE
================================
This technique cannot produce textured polygons or
perform per-pixel shading methods such as Phong or
Goraud, because of the limitations of the console.

=============================
  LIMITATIONS OF THE ENGINE
=============================
Our engine is making use of the fact that our object
is always at the same position. Because of this, its
polygons will never leave the screen or go out of
camera bounds, and we can afford to not implement
any kind of 2D or 3D clipping to adjust polygons.

=============================
    NOTE ON OPTIMIZATION
=============================
This example is not particularly optimized. Even
drawing just this object with no clipping, you can
see how CPU usage reaches 90% at some points. It is
possible to achieve a more optimized result with
various techniques, but this tutorial was written
in this way to make the code more readable.

Still, to make a fully optimized engine it would
be necessary to use assembly language to optimize
key parts of the calculation and drawing process.
