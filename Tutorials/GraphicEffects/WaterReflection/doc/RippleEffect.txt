=======================
  RIPPLE EFFECT
=======================
To make this effect work we need to split the reflected area into
horizontal scanlines (1 region each). This effect works by using a
sine function as offset, so that at each screen scanline we draw
not the reflected line that would correspond, but we select one of
the adjacent scanlines as indicated by the sine function.

To account for the distance making things appear smaller in camera,
we take origin at the horizon Y coordinate and use a square root to
make the waves progressively larger towards the camera (screen bottom).

A ripple function similar to the one used in the code can be seen
plotted in the image that comes in this folder.

You can toggle ripple effect on/off using button A.


=======================
  LIGHTING EFFECT
=======================
What we want to do is apply light on the back part of the waves, and
shadows on the front. We can identify those parts with the derivative
of the ripple function, which we can approximate as simply using cosine
instead of sine (not exact because of the square root, but it works).

Light is applied by ussing additive blending mode with a helper white
line region. Shadow is applied simply using the multiply color with a
helper black line region.

You can toggle lighting effect on/off using button B.


=======================
  SEAFLOOR SEETHROUGH
=======================
Towards the camera, the seefloor can progressively be seen more clearly
behind the reflections. To do this we control the opacity of the drawn
reflection per line, decreasing it towards the screen bottom.


=======================
  MOVEMENT OF WAVES
=======================
Since our ripple function is a sine, to make it cycle we simply add a
factor between 0 and 2*pi to the sine during all current frame. Then
we make that factor proportional to: frames mod 90.


=======================
 NOTE ON OPTIMIZATION
=======================
Note that the ripple function could easily be precalculated, even for
each of the 90 animation frames. This could greatly increase speed,
making all needed calculations a simple lookup. The same can be done
with the ripple slope.

However, getting rid of sin/cos/sqrt is not a big difference for the
console, since the CPU can do those calculations in a sincle cycle. The
speed increase will rather come for removing the function call overhead
and eliminate expression calculations.
