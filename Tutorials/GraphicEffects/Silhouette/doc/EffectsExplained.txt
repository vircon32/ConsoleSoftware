In this tutorial we are only applying 1 effect, which
is turning an image into its own silhouette. Button A
allows to toggle between day scene (regular images)
and night scene (drawn with silhouette effect).

   IMAGE SILHOUETTE EFFECT
=============================
Drawing the whole image as black is easy: just use
black as the multiply color and draw the needed region.

To achieve the light border effect we first draw that
same region 4 times using additive blending. Each time
we offset the image 1 pixel in each of the 4 directions
(up,down,left,right). That will produce the effect of
expanding the whole original contour 1 pixel.

Since most contour pixels will overlap in those 4 times
the region is drawn, the lighting effect is amplified.
Still, this method would not work with images that
have a contour that is black or very dark.
