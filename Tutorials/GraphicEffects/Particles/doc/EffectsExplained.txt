In this tutorial we are applying particle effects,
consisting on creating and simulating a series of
water drops. A text on screen will tell us the total
amount of drops on the scene at any given moment.

=============================
   WATER PARTICLES EFFECT
=============================
This particle system uses dynamic memory to implement
2 lists of water drops. These lists are updated and
drawn every frame.

On one hand, our tap will create large water drops
every frame. These will be simulated applying gravity
until they reach the floor. Every large drop that goes
below floor level will be destroyed, and in its place
a small drop bouncing up will be created.

Small drops are kept in a separate list. They are
created with a varying speed and angle, depending on
their creation position and a random factor. Then they
are simulated with gravity until they get below floor
level and are destroyed.
