In this tutorial we are applying 2 different types
of motion blur. It's always either one or the other.
Button A allows to toggle between them. 

=============================
   FULL-SCREEN BLUR EFFECT
=============================
This is done by using the multiply color to draw the
background not completely opaque. That way the previous
frames can be slightly seen through, creating the blur
effect for all moving objects automatically.

=============================
  SINGLE OBJECT BLUR EFFECT
=============================
To blur only the player ship and not the rest we need
to draw the background fully opaque, so we will have to
draw a motion blur manually. We do this by having an
array to store the sequence of last ship positions. Then
we draw all of them with progressively higher opacity.
