In this tutorial we are only applying 1 effect, which
is changing the overall color of an image. Buttons A,
B, X and Y let you cycle through the available colors
for each character part.

=============================
     PALETTE SWAP EFFECT
=============================
This is not really a palette swap as was done in old
systems, since Vircon32 does not work with palettes
at all. To mimic the effect we decompose an image into
different parts so that each of them can be assigned
a color independently.

To achieve the color change we only need that each of
the image parts in our texture is saved in mainly
white color, perhaps with some shading in its darker
parts. The reason is that we will be using the GPU's
multiply color feature to control that region's color.
This is based on the fact that white*color = that same
color when multiply is applied.
