# Vircon32 assembly tutorials
-----------------------------

This tutorial is a series of small example programs written in Vircon32 assembly language.

Each folder contains a short example with a Readme file and abundant comments to guide on how the code is written. The examples are numbered in increasing difficulty, so it is advised to follow them in order.

In addition to the base programs, each readme file proposes a couple of variants/additions as an exercise for learning assembly.
