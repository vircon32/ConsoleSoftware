  NOTES:
---------------------------
    This version of solitaire is based on the original Windows game,
    at the hard difficulty level (drawing 3 flips cards each time).
    There is no guarantee that any particular game is winnable, it all
    depends on luck: deck shuffling for each game determines this.
