      CHIP-8 EMULATOR FOR VIRCON32 CONSOLE
------------------------------------------------
         Released on October 13th, 2022
================================================


  HOW TO USE THIS EMULATOR:
---------------------------
    This is an emulator of Chip-8, which was a virtual game machine
    used in some old graphic calculators. As an emulator it will need
    to use a Chip-8 ROM file to emulate.
    
    You can use any regular Chip-8 ROM file by converting it into a
    Vircon32 memory card that this emulator can load. For that, use
    the converter program called "chip8tovircon32". Once you have
    loaded the memory card with your Chip-8 ROM, you can start/reset
    the emulator and begin playing the game in Vircon32.
    
    Since Chip-8 uses a keyboard with 16 keys (0-9 and A-F) you will
    need to use the first 2 Vircon32 gamepads to map all 16 keys.
    Different Chip-8 games use different keys, so this emulator
    allows you to cycle through 4 different gamepad button layouts
    to try to find a better mapping for each game. You may do that
    by pressing Start on gamepad 2.
    
    You can also use gamepad 2 to try different screen colors (by
    pressing right) and control the CPU speed of the Chip-8 machine
    (pressing up and down).
