# Console BIOSes
-----------------

This folder includes sources meant for console BIOS. These projects are a bit different from normal console software (such as games), since they are intended just to govern console boot-up and handle special situations such as software errors. Also, a BIOS needs to be compiled with specialized parameters in order to produce a binary file able to be run from a different memory region than a cartridge.

An emulator should always use the standard BIOS or another equivalent one, but it is possible to create different BIOS programs.
